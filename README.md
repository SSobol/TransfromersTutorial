# Transfromers Tutorial
Transformers are current state-of-the-art for sequence-to-sequence conversion tasks and generative AI. This lesson will illustrate the idea of transformers demonstrated over a case of next location prediction in mobility sequences. In this short Jupyter tutorial you will learn how to design, implement, train, and evaluate a transformer model in PyTorch.
